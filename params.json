{"name":"Involve","tagline":"Android monophonic synth","body":"### Welcome to Involve.\r\n\r\nInvolve is a monophonic synthesiser designed to be played as a real time instrument. With an emphasis on real time control using faders, this gives an advantage over the usual virtal knob in that where the device is touched is the control being adjusted. All of the parameters can be assigned to the accelerometer to utilise movement as a form of control.\r\n\r\n### Multi module\r\n\r\nInvolve has been designed to be more than just a single synth, It is a collection of synth modules utilising common core code, ui and control. At present there are two modules, A single oscillator virtual analogue synth with delay, And Super Sawer, a 5 union oscillator with sub generator for them large phat sounds.\r\n\r\nThere are currently more modules under development. Being an open source project, we welcome suggestions and pull requests.\r\n\r\n### Getting Involve \r\n\r\nOn Google play store \r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studio6plus1.involve\r\n\r\nOr click the links at the top of the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
